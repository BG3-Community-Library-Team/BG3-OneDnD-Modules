### [Warlock Patron Spells](Class_Warlock/PatronSpells/)

This mod uses the Compatibility Framework to add the Patron 'Expanded Spells' you have as always prepared.

> [Nexusmods](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5525)

### [Warlock Magical Cunning](Class_Warlock/MagicalCunning/)

Magical Cunning is a new OneDnD feature that allows a Warlock to quickly regain a certain number of spell slots.

If all your Warlock spell slots are expended, you can replenish half of those spell slots (round up). Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long rest.

### [Starry Wisp Cantrip](Spells_Cantrip/StarryWisp/)

Starry Wisp is a new OneDnD cantrip for Bards and Druids.

You launch a mote of light at one creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 Radiant damage, and until the end of your next turn, it emits Dim Light in a 10-foot radius and can’t benefit from the Invisible condition.
