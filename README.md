Starry Wisp is a new OneDnD cantrip for Bards and Druids.

You launch a mote of light at one creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 Radiant damage, and until the end of your next turn, it emits Dim Light in a 10-foot radius and canâ€™t benefit from the Invisible condition.
